A map of the hospital is made available to HelpMate, from which it is able to generate a path from any location in the hospital to any destination.

A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, we derive new results on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and present algorithms for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing and analysis conditions. Implementation details and computational examples are also presented.},

Instead of relying on physical barriers or merely detecting when someone enters the area, the collaborative system must monitor the position of every person who enters the work space in time for the robot to react. The TC 184/SC 2/WG 3 Industrial Safety group within the International Organization for Standard(ISO) is developing the standards to help ensure collaborative robots operate safely. Collaborative robots require sophisticated sensing technologies that must handle dynamic interactions between the robot and the human. One potential safety risk is the occlusion of a safety sensor's field of view due to placement of objects or the movement of people in front of a safety sensor. In this situation the robot could shut down as soon as even a single sensor was partially occluded. Unfortunately this could greatly diminish the extent to which the robot could work collaboratively. In this paper we examine how a human tracking system using multiple laser line scanners [3]was adapted to work with a robot Speed and Separation Monitoring (SSM) safety system and further modified to include occlusion monitoring.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICIT.2010.5472487},
	abstract = {Today, robotic systems are bridging the gaps between global economy, social needs, and logistics focusing on sustainable development solutions. Everyday new robotic applications can be found in literature and media. Some of them are basically entertainment toys. Nevertheless, the great majority of them is used inside industries, performing several tasks (painting, welding, moving materials, etc.). In a scenario of global economy growth, any sustainable solution that can reduce the product final cost is welcome. This article presents researches on robotic forklifts for intelligent warehouses developed at the Mechatronics Lab at USP-EESC in Brazil. We show three key-routines that determine the Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) behavior: the routing algorithm (that computes the overall task execution time and the minimum global path of each AGV using a topological map of the warehouse), the local path planning algorithm (based on A* it searches for the local minimum path between two nodes of the warehouse topological map), and an auto-localization algorithm (that applies an Extended Kalman Filter - EKF - to estimate the AGVs actual positions). In order to validate the algorithms developed, several tests were carried out using the simulation software Player/Stage. The results obtained were encouraging and the router developed was able to solve traffic jams and collisions, before sending the final paths to the robots. In a near future all algorithms will be implemented using mini- robotic forklifts and a scaled environment built in our lab.},

F. Background. In view of the burgeoning use of robots in industry, it is appropriate and timely that OSHA develop and provide a technical information instruction delineating guidelines on robotics safety for dissemination to employers and employees interested in robotics safety. Compliance and Consultation personnel may use the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) American National Safety Standard ANSI-RIA R15.06-1986, "Industrial Robots and Industrial Robot Systems - Safety Requirements," for robotics safety evaluation. Copies of the standard are available from the American National Standards Institute, Inc., 1430 Broadway, New York, New York 10018.
