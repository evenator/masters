CAD Allen's frame
CAD/find models of all components
Figure out component mounting and weight distribution
Order computer
Order inverter and related cabling
Order Kinect (Do we have one?)
Fabricate all mechanical parts (frame rails, mounting brackets)
Finalize sensor package
Rebuild Allen mechanically
Rewire Allen
Format Allen's new computer
Get Allen running with existing ROS software to control mobile base and receive sensor data
Calibrate Allen's systems
Create ROS gateway to control the IRB-120
Set up IRB-120 to respond to control from network
Adapt/Develop ROS arm_kinematics/kdl_arm_kinematics/move_arm packages to control IRB-120
Create ROS representation of IRB-120 (Joint/Link model, tied to 3D model for visualization)
Create ROS representation of full robot, incorporating existing drive base model and IRB-120 model
Demonstrate working playback of robot model from recorded data
Figure out what the deal is with HS network comms to IRC5
Test IRB-120 with ABB software (prove it moves, run a small RAPID program)
Test IRB-120 with ABB software running from inverter power (prove it moves, run a small RAPID program)
